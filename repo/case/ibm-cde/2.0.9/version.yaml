  description: With the Cognos Dashboards service, you can use sophisticated visualizations
    in an analytics project to identify patterns in your data so you can make timely
    and effective decisions. No coding needed. You can drag data onto the canvas and
    use various visualizations to communicate comparisons or understand relationships
    and trends in the data. With this service, you can quickly build visualizations
    to answer important questions or provide the foundation for more in-depth analysis.
    You can create analytics projects with Cognos Dashboards regardless of whether
    you have the Watson Studio service installed. You can install the Cognos Dashboards
    and Watson Studio services in any order.
