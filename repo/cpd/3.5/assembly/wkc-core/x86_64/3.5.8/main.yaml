# type will be either "assembly" or "module", mandatory
# mandatory - once this file uploaded, we will not delete any more,
# but if this version too old, the download/deploy will tell this product is not valid any more, and show the latest version
# We can also add dev, candidate etc here and telling the user what is the state
# This license will show at the download time and the install time, optional. If specified, then will ask user to explicitly accept
# The name is for information only, download/deploy command will refer this product based on file name, mandatory
# Descriptioin is optional
# architecture is optional
# if this is missing, each module/sub-assembly has to specify architecture, if both specified, syntax error
# sub assembly have to be homogerious architucture
# Do NOT use for now - Optional, this will be the final override yaml to override all values in the chart, including those defined in module yaml
# To be discussed after Oct - consult with the install team to make sure this is implemented
#overrideValues:
# install: override.yaml
# upgrade: override.yaml
# installOverride: override.yaml
# bricks is mandatory, it could contains another "product"
# When all the modules are obtained, it has to check if there is duplicate of names, if so, error out,
# although we allow include the sub "assembly", but the sub-assembly can ONLY allow modules, but not another assembly
# We will have linter to check to make sure the rules
#
# Version is hardcoded for now, we will address the version compatiblities after Oct GA
