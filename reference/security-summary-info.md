## Overview

<a id="markdown-what-is-the-security-summary" name="what-is-the-security-summary"></a>

### What is the Security Summary?

The Security Summary is a PDF file that explains the security posture of an IBM Containerized product. The summary indicates compliance with several IBM Certification security metrics. The security metrics included are based on IBM standards, guidelines, and best practices for delivering secure, enterprise grade software for Red Hat&reg; OpenShift&reg; Container Platform.

<a id="markdown-why-does-ibm-provide-these-summaries" name="why-does-ibm-provide-these-summaries"></a>

### Why does IBM provide these summaries?

The Security Summary provides IBM customers with a simple way to understand the product's software posture before deployment. The summary helps IBM make the security posture of its products transparent, known, and easily understandable.

<a id="markdown-who-is-the-intended-audience" name="who-is-the-intended-audience"></a>

### Who is the intended audience?

The summary is intended for OpenShift Container Platform system and application administrators, and security professionals who deploy, plan to deploy, evaluate, or secure container workloads in a cluster.  These metrics can be used to apply the appropriate controls and configurations to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster and topology to protect workloads and provide secure access.  

<a id="markdown-how-does-ibm-determine-the-compliance" name="how-does-ibm-determine-the-compliance"></a>

### How does IBM determine the compliance?

All IBM containerized software goes through a process that is called IBM Certification before publishing. An overview of the process is described in this [IBM Developer blog post](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/the-ibm-kubernetes-certification-process/). IBM assesses over 100 metrics through this certification process to measure and ensure compliance with a rigorous set of standards and best practices. One of the attributes of IBM Certification is the IBM Security and Privacy by Design (SPbD) program. For more information on SPbD, see [Security in Development](https://www.ibm.com/trust/security-spbd). This summary takes a few critical security metrics from the certification process and externalizes it. Through that process some of the metrics are automated in the continuous integration and delivery pipeline while others are verified with documentation. The attributes with "automated" in their name are validated by an IBM internal linter tool.

<a id="markdown-where-is-the-summary" name="where-is-the-summary"></a>

### Where is the summary?

The summary is shipped as part of the product's [Container Application Software for Enterprises (CASE)](https://github.com/IBM/case). A CASE is a well-defined file structure that provides packaging and metadata about the software, including its certification state and provenance.

To view the Security Summary, follow the steps below:

1. Browse to [IBM Cloud-pak GitHub Case repo](https://github.com/IBM/cloud-pak/tree/master/repo/case).
2. Browse to the desired product and version (ibm-example/v1.0).
3. Download the tgz file.
4. Extract the tgz file.  For example:

    `$ tar â€“xzvf <\download-location>/ibm-example-1.0.tgz`

5. Change the working directory to the `certificates/security` folder.  For example:

    `$ cd ibm-example/certifications/security`

6. View the summary with your PDF viewer

## Certification Metrics

Each line of the Security Summary is explained in detail below to help you understand the criteria that are used to determine compliance.

<a id="markdown-1-image-vulnerability-management" name="1-image-vulnerability-management"></a>

### 1. Image Vulnerability Management

Image vulnerability management consists of security metrics for security vulnerabilities that are found in the packaged images.

<a id="markdown-_11-all-product-images-have-been-scanned-for-vulnerabilities-prior-to-release_" name="_11-all-product-images-have-been-scanned-for-vulnerabilities-prior-to-release_"></a>

#### _1.1 All product images have been scanned for vulnerabilities prior to release_

**Description:**

All product container images must be scanned with a set of approved tools before product shipment. IBM updates images as new [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://cve.mitre.org/) are discovered over time. Any vulnerabilities not resolved before product shipment are tracked through the [IBM Product Security Incident Response (PSIRT)](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/psirt/) process.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Confirmed by reviewing scan reports from an approved tool. Common tools that are used include:

- Red Hat image certification
- IBM Vulnerability Advisor

<a id="markdown-2-principle-of-least-privilege" name="2-principle-of-least-privilege"></a>

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege

Principle of least privilege consists of security metrics ensuring products run with the fewest privileges necessary.

<a id="markdown-_21-run-with-the-red-hat-restricted-security-context-constraintautomated_" name="_21-run-with-the-red-hat-restricted-security-context-constraintautomated_"></a>

#### _2.1 Run with the Red Hat restricted security context constraint(automated)_

**Description:**

IBM products must use the restricted [security context constraint(SCC)](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html). This SCC is the default given to any ServiceAccount in a cluster. This is the most restrictive SCC shipped with Red Hat&reg; OpenShift&reg; Container Platform.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Confirmed the pod and container specifications use the restricted SCC

<a id="markdown-_22-all-product-containers-specify-a-numeric-user-in-their-dockerfile-or-equivalent-oci-build-file-for-container-images_" name="_22-all-product-containers-specify-a-numeric-user-in-their-dockerfile-or-equivalent-oci-build-file-for-container-images_"></a>

#### _2.2 All product containers specify a numeric USER in their Dockerfile or equivalent OCI build file for container images_

**Description:**   A container that is created without the USER field specified in the image build file could run as the root user.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Confirmed the USER field is set in container build file

<a id="markdown-_23-no-product-containers-use-sudo_" name="_23-no-product-containers-use-sudo_"></a>

#### _2.3 No product containers use sudo_

**Description:**

A container cannot execute commands using ``sudo`` because those commands will run with elevated privileges.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Confirmed by checking 3 conditions:

1. sysctls to use ``sudo`` is turned off in the container
2. ``sudo`` privilege escalation is NOT used in a container image(s)

<a id="markdown-_24-no-product-containers-run-as-root_" name="_24-no-product-containers-run-as-root_"></a>

#### _2.4 No product containers run as root_

**Description:**

A container must run with an [arbitrary userID](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/openshift_images/create-images.html#images-create-guide-openshift_create-images) to prevent collision on the host machine. A container can run with specific id (non-restricted SCC) although arbitrary id is preferred.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Confirmed that root user is disabled in the Pod and Container security context.

<a id="markdown-3-host-and-container-isolation" name="3-host-and-container-isolation"></a>

### 3. Host and Container Isolation

#### _4.2 Product provides default NetworkPolicies that limit network traffic_

**Description:**

A containerized software product must use Kubernetes [NetworkPolicies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) to ensure that network traffic between pods are as desired (that is, unsolicited traffic is blocked). A NetworkPolicy is an instance specific firewall that is defined by the product for the cluster.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Confirmed that at least 1 NetworkPolicy resource is configured in the deployment

<a id="markdown-5-data-security" name="5-data-security"></a>

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Confirmed that all containers have the following labels:

- app.kubernetes.io/name
- app.kubernetes.io/managed-by
- app.kubernetes.io/instance
- app.kubernetes.io/ownerReference
- helm.sh/chart if created by a Helm chart
